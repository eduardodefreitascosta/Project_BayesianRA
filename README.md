# Note: This model is heavy. It will take several minutes (eventually hours) running.

## This is a paper describying a Bayesian inference model for prevalence estimation discussed in a risk assessment context. The aim is to show how to run and interpret the Bayesian inference to use the output as a measurement of uncertainty in Risk assessment models.


## The paper is available online: 




## Instrucitons to reproduce the results from the paper "A systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis about *Salmonella* spp. prevalence on raw chicken meat".


### 1 Download the files to a local or cloud folder. The best option is to download all files zipped;

### 2 Unzip and open the R project "Projetc_BayesianRA.Rproj" (it is highly recommended to use RStudio);

### 3 In R, you can open and run the file\ 

  + "Main.R" (available in the tab "Files")\ 
  
  
### Note that two folders were created:
  - **Results**: Stores the results of the models;
  
  - **Figures**: Stores the figures of the models.
  
  - The simulation starts after installing several libraries. It may take a few hours to run.
